# SD-card-TivaC-library

This is a library to read SD cards that have FAT32 filesystem (single partition) using TM4C123GH6PM microcontroller. To test it, you can directly import the project (sdcard-spi)in Code Composer Studio.

Please note that in case that you use another board the configuration will probably not be valid without making some changes.

To check connections, available functions, etc, you can use the guide called 'SD card Tiva C library guide'. Additional information is available at the Wiki section: https://github.com/Javierma/SD-card-TivaC-library/wiki
